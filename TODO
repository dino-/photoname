- Update licensing to 2011

- Add support for different camera filename formats, check with the Olympus.

- I'm wondering if it would be possible to have a post-command switch that could specify something to be done after other processing is done. This came up when i was thinking about rolling jhead -autorot rotation behavior into this program. But I'm reluctant to make this program have direct knowledge of such tools and procedures.
   An example:
   --post-cmd='jhead -autorot %f'

   What syntax to use for variables in such strings?

- Allow user to specify permissions for newly-created dirs and files. Bonus points for parsing the octal codes everyone knows and loves.

- Add a --force switch to disregard existing links.

- Deal gracefully with unknown dates. This means not just putting pictures into the 0000/0000-00-00 directory, but making sure that the _### serial number part is incremented from the highest one in there.

- Allow additional switch for part of filenames for initials of photographer: _xyz  Call this the suffix? (-s --suffix)

- Add the Homepage item to the debian/control that you see now in more recent packages. Use dh_make on something to see what it looks like, something like this:
   Homepage: <url>
