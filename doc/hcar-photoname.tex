photoname is a command-line utility for renaming/moving photo image files. The new folder location and naming are determined by the EXIF photo shoot date and the usually-camera-assigned serial number, often appearing in the filename.

photoname is on Hackage and can be acquired using darcs or other methods. See the project page below for more.
