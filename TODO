features that would be nice:

- Allow user to specify permissions for newly-created dirs and files. Bonus points for parsing the octal codes everyone knows and loves.

- Add a --force switch to disregard existing links.

- Need to write testing script(s)

- Deal gracefully with unknown dates. This means not just putting pictures into the 0000/0000-00-00 directory, but making sure that the _### serial number part is incremented from the highest one in there.
