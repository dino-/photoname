What's our specification?

- For each file processed
   - Has an exif date? Rename based on that.
   - Has no date but is named with b36? Use that date.

- Check for file existance, don't clobber anything.
- Include a -n --no-action switch
- Include a -f --force switch?
- Include a -r --rename switch?
   Default behavior is to hard link files to new locations, which is safer,
   but may not be supported by your operating environment. Use the -r
   switch to rename (move) files instead.
- Include a -p --permissions switch?
   Alter the original (or only) file's permissions?

- How are we going to select the _0000?
- What do the Panasonic FX07 filenames look like? Olympus?


- For each file
   - Does it have EXIF date?
   - Can we get a date out of its filename?
      - b36 format
      - literal format (like mobile phone files)
   - Does it have EXIF Image Number?
   - Does it have Image Number in filename?


- Use time manipulation code in System.Time
