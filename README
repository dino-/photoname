*about*

photoname is a command-line utility for renaming/moving photo image
files. The new folder location and naming are determined by two things:
the photo shoot date information contained within the file's EXIF tags
and the usually-camera-assigned serial number, often appearing in the
filename.

This program is known to build with GHC 6.12.1 and 6.10.4 on systems where System.Posix (unix) and exif packages are available.


*install*

With cabal-install, get it directly from Hackage:

   $ cabal install photoname

Or manually after unpacking source:

   $ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
   $ runhaskell Setup.lhs build
   $ runhaskell Setup.lhs test
   $ runhaskell Setup.lhs install
